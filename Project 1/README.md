This section will be used to upload all my Udacity projects in data science.

This is the first project i worked on udacity data science course was about education proformance analysis. I have selected an education dataset taken from Ibrahim Aljarah https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data.

In the beginning, I will talk about my motivation for doing this project. First, I am very interested in understanding how education works and how it could develop. And second, this project was the first in this course. So I was excited to work on it and learn from this experience.

For this project, the required libraries are: - pandas: It's used to read and deal with data you select. - matplotlib: It's used to visualise data.

In this project, the three main answer questions were: - Which country got the highest Parent school Satisfaction? - How do absences affect parent-school satisfaction? - Which topics got the highest number of raised hands?

To conclude, it is clear from analyzing the data that Kuwait got the highest parent-school satisfaction. Also, we can notice that the more children attend their classes at school, the more parent satisfaction children get in overall performance. Lastly, the most subject got raised hands numbers was IT.
